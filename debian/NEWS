freecol (0.8.4+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  To work around bug #560056 on openjdk, IPV6 network stack is now
  disabled by default. If you experience problems connecting to remote
  servers, you can try enabling it back by passing --enable-ipv6 as 
  first argument to freecol.

  Saved games from version before 0.8 WILL NOT WORK with this version. 
  Finish your games before upgrading !

freecol (0.7.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Apparently, saves for earlier versions of freecol might not be valid 
  with this version; please exercise caution, as this problem will 
  probably never get fixed.

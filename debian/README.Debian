freecol for Debian
------------------

This package has been repackaged from source, as upstream tarballs include
binary-only libraries. This will hopefully change in next releases.

Additionally, the directory for saves has been moved to ~/.freecol, as
it doesn't clutter home directories this way and seems to be the
current (unspoken, at least) policy for games.
